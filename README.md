<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Eren</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate backend developer </h3>
Hello! I'm a dedicated and passionate Software Engineer with a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I hold a degree in this field and have been working as a software engineer for the past two years.

My journey in the tech world began with game development, using Unity and C#. This experience provided me with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. Since then, I have transitioned into backend development and have become proficient in ASP.NET and various other backend technologies. Additionally, I am exploring front-end development with Angular to broaden my skill set.

During my studies as an Electrical and Electronics Engineer, I worked on an exciting project where I developed an autonomous flying quadcopter. This project involved using Python with OpenCV for computer vision and ROS (Robot Operating System) for control and coordination.

I am always eager to learn new languages and technologies, and I am continuously seeking opportunities to grow and expand my expertise.
